          I acquired my frontend developer skills through self-teaching. I
          completed and earned a certificate in frontend development from

          I also took courses for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Responsive Web Design,
          and Web Development Fundamentals from

        <p>
          With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS (SCSS), JavaScript (TypeScript),
          and React, I bring creativity and attention to detail to every project
          I work on. I am dedicated to staying updated with the latest industry
          trends and delivering high-quality solutions to clients.

      <div>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you'll find me enjoying a game of checkers
          (draughts), watching a movie, listening to my favorite music or
          tending to my garden. I believe that just as a well-maintained garden
          flourishes, so do well-designed websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also believe in the power of technology to make a positive impact,
          and I am excited about the prospect of becoming a fullstack developer
          to broaden my skills and contribute even more to the world of web
          development.
